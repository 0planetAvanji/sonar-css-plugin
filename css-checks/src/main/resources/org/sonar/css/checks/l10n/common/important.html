    The <code>!important</code> flag is used to artificially increase the specificity of a given property value in
    a rule. This is usually an indication that the specificity of the entire CSS has gotten a bit out of control and
    needs to be refactored. The more frequently the <code>!important</code> flag is found, the more likely it is that
    developers are having trouble styling parts of a page effectively.
