    The problems with <code>@extend</code> are manifold, but to summarise:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>It’s actually worse for performance than mixins are.</strong> Gzip favours repetition, so CSS files
            with greater repetition (i.e. mixins) achieve a greater compression delta.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>It’s greedy.</strong> Sass’ <code>@extend</code> will extend every instance of a class that it
            finds, giving us crazy-long selector chains that look like this.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>It moves things around your codebase.</strong> Source order is vital in CSS, so moving selectors
            around your project should always be avoided.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>It obscures the paper-trail.</strong><code>@extend</code> hides a lot of complexity in your Sass
            that you need to unpick more gradually, whereas the multiple class approach puts all of the information
            front-and-center in your markup.
        </li>
    </ul>
