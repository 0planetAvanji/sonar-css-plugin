<p>
    This rule template can be used to create rules which will be triggered when a property matches a given regular
    expression.
</p>
<p>
    For example, one can create a rule with the regular expression "<code>.*animation.*</code>" to match all the
    animation properties (to warn developers not to use them for some reasons for instance).
</p>
<p>
    Note that, in order to match "animation" regardless of the case, the "<code>(?i)</code>" modifier can be prepended
    to the expression, as in "<code>(?i).*animation.*</code>".
</p>
<p>
    See <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">Java
    documentation</a> for detailed regular expression syntax.
</p>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>
    Less interpolated properties are not checked against this rule. For instance, the following piece of code does not
    raise an issue when the regular expression is set to <code>(?i).*animation.*</code>:
</p>
<pre>
.mybox {
  foo-@{animation}-bar: green;
}
</pre>
