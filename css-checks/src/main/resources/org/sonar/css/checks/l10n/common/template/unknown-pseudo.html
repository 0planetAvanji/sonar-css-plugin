<p>
    The list of supported CSS pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes is growing quite large, and it's very easy to miss a
    typo.
</p>
<p>
    This rule checks each pseudo-element and pseudo-class name to make sure that it is a known CSS pseudo. All
    vendor-prefixed pseudos are ignored because vendors may add in their own pseudos at any point in time.
</p>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
section:hello(1) { /* Noncompliant: 'hello' isn't a known pseudo-class */
}

section::abc { /* Noncompliant: 'abc' isn't a known pseudo-element */
}
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
section:has(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) {
}

p::first-line {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

section:-moz-hello(1) { /* Compliant: 'hello' is a vendor-prefixed pseudo-class */
}

section::-moz-abc { /* Compliant: 'hello' is a vendor-prefixed pseudo-element */
}
</pre>
