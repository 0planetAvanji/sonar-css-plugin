<p>
    An empty style sheet is one that doesn't contain any declaration. Empty style sheets are useless and should be
    removed.
</p>

<p>
    Empty <code>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;...&lt;style&gt;</code> embedded in HTML are considered as empty
    "style sheets" and should be removed as well.
