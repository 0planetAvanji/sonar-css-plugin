    The star hack is a famous (or perhaps infamous) technique for applying CSS properties only to Internet Explorer
    prior to version 8. By placing an asterisk immediately before the property name, older versions of Internet Explorer
    treated as if the asterisk isn't there while other browsers simply ignore it. For example:
</p>
<pre>
.mybox {
  border: 1px solid black;
  padding: 5px;
  width: 100px;
  *width: 200px;
}
</pre>
<p>
    In this example, the <code>*width</code> property is treated as if it were <code>width</code> by Internet Explorer 7
    and earlier, so it uses the value of 200px; other browsers skip that property and use the value of 100px.
</p>
<p>Star hack relies on an old CSS parser bug in Internet Explorer, and as such, some prefer not to use it.</p>
