    The universal selector (<code>*</code>) matches all elements. Though convenient for selecting a group of elements at
    a time, the universal selector causes performance issues when used as the key part (far-right) of a selector. For
    example, this type of rule should be avoided:
</p>
<pre>
.mybox * {
  background: #fff;
  color: #000;
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
}
</pre>
<p>
    Browsers evaluate selectors from right-to-left, so this rule begins by first matching every element in the document.
    After that, each of those elements must be inspected to see if it matches the next criteria, which is having an
    ancestor with the class of mybox. The more complex the selector containing <code>*</code>, the slower the evaluation
    becomes. For this reason, it's recommended to avoid using the universal selector as the key part of a selector.
