<h2>Require compatible vendor prefixes</h2>
<p>
Experimental CSS properties are typically implemented using vendor prefixes
 until the final behavior has been established and agreed upon. Most CSS3
 properties have vendor-prefixed equivalents for multiple vendors,
 including Firefox (-moz), Safari/Chrome (-webkit),
 Opera (-o), and
 Internet Explorer (-ms). It's easy to forget to include the vendor
 prefixed version of a property when there are so many to keep track of.</p>
