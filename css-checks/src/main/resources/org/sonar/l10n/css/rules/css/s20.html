<h2>Do not use 4095 selectors in one sheet file</h2>
<p>
    Web applications concatenate CSS files to improve performance, which can result in large numbers of style rules in a single file. Enter the
    <a href="http://marc.baffl.co.uk/browser_bugs/css-selector-limit/">4095 selector limitation for IE browsers</a>. An IE bug whereby the browser will only apply style for the first 4095 selectors declared per file. Impacted browsers include IE6, IE7, IE8 and IE9.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    Reduce the number of CSS selectors per file to a number less than 4096. Several approaches for doing so include:
    <ul>
        <li>Refactoring existing CSS</li>
        <li>Splitting the CSS payload into multiple files</li>
        <li>Reevaluating current browser support strategy (wink, wink)</li>
    </ul>
